# c#-implementation-for-server-updated-application
 example of implementation of my "Server-Updated-App" project in c#



## Getting Started : 

first, clone both this repository and [my original project's repository](https://github.com/DarknessRisesFromBelow/server-Updated-App) and then run server.py on your wanted server machine.

then, in server.py (present in original repository) replace "insert link to repository" with a link to a repository containing your applications files.

then, in client.cpp(present in this repository) replace "insert your own IP here" with the ip of your server machine.

when updating the application all you need to do is to push updates to github. 

updates will take around a hour to push to all devices (can be changed by changing the INTREVAL_TIMEOUT int in client.cpp)

enjoy.
